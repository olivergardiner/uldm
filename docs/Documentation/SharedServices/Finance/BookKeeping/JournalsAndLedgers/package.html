			<p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>Journals and Ledgers used to be physical books in which transactions were recorded but, in the world of computer-based Accounting Systems, these physical concepts have less significance. However, it is still useful to be able to classify how we group transactions and Accounts into Journals and Ledgers and so it is trivial to declare &lt;&lt;ReferenceData&gt;&gt; entities to reflect these concepts. JournalEntries are &quot;recorded&quot; in Journals and Postings are recorded in the Ledger relevant to the Account to which the Posting is made.</p>

<p>The only remaining point to examine is what we consider to be an Account. With Financial Accounting separate&nbsp;from Management Accounting then statutory needs to can be met with a single hierarchy to represent the structure of the General Ledger. In an Integrated Accounting System a minor additional complexity is required to allow us to use the Account to understand the performance of the business. This is described in detail in the <span class="pointer" onclick="$('#main').load('Documentation/SharedServices/Finance/BookKeeping/ChartOfAccounts/package.html');window.scrollTo(0,0);">ChartOfAccounts</span> section but is easily achieved by allowing an Account to be defined by the intersection of multiple hierarchies. The GL Account hierarchy will always be required but other segments or dimensions can be added as desired. In this way, the disposition of the accounts with regard to any one hierarchy can easily be determined by aggregating all of the accounts for that specific hierarchy.</p>
