			<p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>The ULDM is intended to be a generic logical model of the data that underpins a variety of industry verticals. It is inherently&nbsp;domain-centric in that all data is modelled within a specific domain where the domain structure is hierarchical. This means that, as well as modelling the specifics of the industry verticals (in vertical domains), the ULDM allows non-industry specific processes (e.g. Finance) to be described within a horizontal Shared Services domain, as well as all domains being able to leverage the same common core of generic concepts (such as primitives and reference data).</p>
</p><p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>While other structures could be considered, the top level of the ULDM is organised as list of vertical domains followed by the Shared Services domain and the Common domain. In principle, the ULDM could efficiently represent the needs of a great many different verticals and their derivatives but, in practice, the associated modelling effort must inevitably be prioritised according to actual need. Accordingly, the scope of the ULDM is necessarily constrained by the needs of its authors and currently focuses on Retail and Financial Services.</p>
</p><p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>Some thought needs to be given to the difference between genuuinely shared services (e.g. Finance and HR) as compared to common capabilities that can be adapted across different industry verticals (e.g. Logistics/Supply Chain, Contact Centre, etc.)</p>
</p><p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>The structure of this documentation deliberately reflects the structure of the ULDM itself and is intended as a detailed guide for those wishing to understand the intent of the model and the thought processes that have driven it.</p>
