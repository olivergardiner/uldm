			<p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>While there is necessarily a direct correspondence between theproducts that are sold to the customer and the goods managed by the supply chain (as otherwise customers might choose to buy products that cannot be fulfilled), the way products are represented to the customer for sale may not always reflect the way they are supplied. At a basic level, the way products are described (i.e. the product attributes) serves a different purpose in the context of&nbsp;selling (attracting&nbsp;a sale) compared to the purpose&nbsp;in the supply chain (storing goods in warehouses and moving them on trucks). However, there may also be more structural changes in selling, e.g. when multiple products are bundled together for sale as a single derived product.</p>

<p>Creating original data is never free and so the cost of maintaining separate views of product for both selling and supply chain must be carefully considered but not implementing this separation is, in practice, an unworkable constraint on the heart of the the retail process - representing the offer in the most appealing way for the customer to maximise the possibility of a sale. However, this does not mean that the processes for managing the data ar required to&nbsp;be inefficient - common data can be copied by value (rather than by direct reference) from one domain to another&nbsp;at no&nbsp;manual cost&nbsp;which then allows for the possibility of changing or augmenting this data in the downstream domain if (and only if) this is deemed appropriate.</p>

<p>Note that the process of copying data by value is not without its challenges - primarily (as with all duplication of data) there is the question of consitency. Again, though, this is entirely manageable as long as absolute clarity is maintained regarding which domain is authoritative with regard which data - anything that is necessarily an artefact of how products are supplied must be mastered within the supply chain while anything that is specific to how products are sold to customers is owned within selling. In practice, the bulk of the work is done in the supply chain processes with the product&nbsp;data in the selling domain providing the cosmetic veneer to make the products look attractive.</p>
</p><p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>Central to the way products are organised for sale is the concept of a Catalogue, which is simply a mechanism for providing a layer of navigation over the complete list of products availble for sale in a given context. Note that this concept is as valid in a physical store as it is online, although the typical business terminology (ranges, assortments and planograms) is different.</p>
