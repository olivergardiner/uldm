			<p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>The Selling sub-domain is concerned with the processes and data required to support the act of transacting with the retail customer for goods and services. As such, the domain essentially splits into a description of the various ways in which the transaction is handled (e.g. Point of Sale, online orders), and the actual products (good and services) which are subject of those transactions.</p>
