			<p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>In its most basic form, a Sales Transaction is an exchange of products (goods and/or&nbsp;services) and monetary funds in the context of an applicable&nbsp;legislatory framework that may impose charges or constraints on the transaction (e.g. sales tax). This view of a Sales Transaction is, however,&nbsp;abstracted from the specifics of how the transaction is enacted. Consequently, this domain also includes sub-domains to describe the elements of the transacting process specific to the following contexts:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="pointer" onclick="$('#main').load('Documentation/Retail/Selling/SalesTransaction/PointOfSale/package.html');window.scrollTo(0,0);">PointOfSale</span> -&nbsp;the purchasing of products in person&nbsp;in a physical store</li>
	<li><span class="pointer" onclick="$('#main').load('Documentation/Retail/Selling/SalesTransaction/CustomerOrder/package.html');window.scrollTo(0,0);">CustomerOrder</span> - the purchasing of products through an order placed for fulfilment (e.g. placed online, by telephone, or some other mechanism)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that a Sales Transaction typically involves the supply of products by the retailer&nbsp;to the customer for an agreed fee, but this situation may reversed in the context of a return which may be thought of as a form of compensating transaction that reverses the effects of some or all of the original transaction.</p>
