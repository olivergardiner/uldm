	<p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>A Position is any role that exists within the Organisation, whether filled or not. While a simple hierarchy could have been used, the abstract Position is further specialised into ChiefExecutive (who has no direct manager but is accountable to the Board, Trustees or similar governance framework) and ManagedPosition which represents every other Position within the Organisation. This structure facilitates the attribute of a ChiefExecutive to an Organisation and also reinforces the fact that the top of any Position hierarchy must be responsible at an Organisation level.</p>

					<td><p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>A Job is the association between an Employee and a Position and is always a current or &quot;live&quot;&nbsp;statement of this assignment. The historical vie of Positions held by an Employee is maintained by the Employee&#39;s employeeHistory since it is inevitable that the definition or existence of the corresponding Positions will vary over time.</p>

<p>The nature of this association is such that an Employee may not be fully allocated to a given Position (e.g. a job share arrangement where two or more Employees are partially allocated to the same Position) and an Employee may also split their effort across more than one Position.</p>

<p>Positions will typically sit within a CostCentre hierarchy that reflects the managerial responsibility for the performance of a part of the Organisation and this responsibilty is asserted by the corresponding Position. In a simple scenario, the&nbsp;cost of&nbsp;an Employee fulfilling a Position could be attributed to the correct CostCentre by simply following the Position hierarchy to the nearest manager with responsibility for a CostCentre. However, in more complex cases it is a) important to understand the allocation of an Employee to a given Position, and b) possible to fund the fulfilment of the Position through other CostObjects (e.g. a Project). Consequently it is the Job that explicitly&nbsp;defines&nbsp;the source of funds that is responsible for the cost of any Position.&nbsp;</p>
