	<p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>A Job is the association between an Employee and a Position and is always a current or &quot;live&quot;&nbsp;statement of this assignment. The historical vie of Positions held by an Employee is maintained by the Employee&#39;s employeeHistory since it is inevitable that the definition or existence of the corresponding Positions will vary over time.</p>

<p>The nature of this association is such that an Employee may not be fully allocated to a given Position (e.g. a job share arrangement where two or more Employees are partially allocated to the same Position) and an Employee may also split their effort across more than one Position.</p>

<p>Positions will typically sit within a CostCentre hierarchy that reflects the managerial responsibility for the performance of a part of the Organisation and this responsibilty is asserted by the corresponding Position. In a simple scenario, the&nbsp;cost of&nbsp;an Employee fulfilling a Position could be attributed to the correct CostCentre by simply following the Position hierarchy to the nearest manager with responsibility for a CostCentre. However, in more complex cases it is a) important to understand the allocation of an Employee to a given Position, and b) possible to fund the fulfilment of the Position through other CostObjects (e.g. a Project). Consequently it is the Job that explicitly&nbsp;defines&nbsp;the source of funds that is responsible for the cost of any Position.&nbsp;</p>

In all cases, the sum of the fundingAmount for all sources of funding must be exactly 1.0</p>
