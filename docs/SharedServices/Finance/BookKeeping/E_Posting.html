	<p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>The generic entity of Posting captures the concept of crediting or debiting an amount to an Account. It is declared as abstract with two concrete sub-entities simply to enforce the basic double entry principle that every posted transaction must involve at least one CreditPosting and at least one DebitPosting. In another context, one might use a type attribute on the Posting entity but the accounting significance of this relationship implies the need for a more robust expression in the model.</p>
</p><p style="white-space: pre-line"><p>Each posting will carry some of the same properties as the corresponding JournalEntry (i.e. Accounting Transaction) which could be considered to represent a denormalisation of the data (as it could be inferred from the JournalEntry). However, A Journal is not an authoritative record of the state of the accounts and not all transactions are necessarily recorded in a Journal, so it is important that Postings to the Ledgers are complete records in their own right.</p>
